# TFLite Model Encryption & Decryption with AES

## Introduction

This project implements encryption and decryption of TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) models using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The approach enhances the security of machine learning models deployed on edge devices by preventing unauthorized access or tampering. OpenSSL is utilized for cryptographic operations, ensuring robust security and efficiency.

## Dependencies

To run this project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **TensorFlow Lite** (for model inference)
- **OpenSSL** (for AES encryption and decryption)
- **CMake** (for building the project, if applicable)
